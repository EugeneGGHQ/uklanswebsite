LanCache.Net provides the ability to reduce your Internet bandwidth consumption in scenarios where you have multiple PC gamers sharing the same Internet connection. Through the use of easy to deploy docker containers we aim to make it easy for you to get a local cache of steam's content servers up and running quickly.

The primary use case is gaming events, such as LAN parties, which need to be able to cope with hundreds or thousands of computers receiving an unannounced patch - without spending a fortune on internet connectivity. Other uses include smaller networks, such as Internet Cafes and home networks, where new games are regularly installed on multiple computers; or multiple independent operating systems on the same computer.
